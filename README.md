# ðŸ›’Monster Arena Game

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

## Project Description

A fully playable game made in Python, using the pygame library. The game is an arena type 
based game where you have to survive each round by defeating enemies. 
The project is originally from a youtube course video for learning Python, by making 5 
different games, made by a youtuber named Clear Code. Here is a link to this course:

The base game was very simple and did not include the round system or the skills upgrade system.
I managed to add those features and it fundamentally improved my knowledge of Python.

## ðŸš€ Features 

Based on the provided code, "Monster Arena" has the following key features:

-Upgradable Skills: Players can upgrade attributes like:
-Damage (costs 500 coins)
-Health (costs 750 coins)
-Running Speed (costs 250 coins)
-Shooting Speed (costs 500 coins)
-Coin Collection: Players earn coins by defeating enemies and can use them for upgrades.
-Immortality Mode: The game starts with temporary invincibility.

#3. Enemy System
-Enemy Spawning: Enemies spawn at predefined locations.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Retr0647/monster-arena-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd monster-arena-game
   ```
3. Need to have Python and pygame installed beforehand.

## ðŸ“„ Documentation
Detailed documentation for all Python functions and project structure can be found in the **`docs/`** folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage
Explore the interactive elemnts of the game by playing it fully. The project serves as a great reference for structuring a 
a fully playable and interactive game as well as the possibilites of the pygame library. It is also a great showcase of Python
classes and object-oriented programming.
