# ⏲️ Timer - Class Documentation

## 🛠 Initialization (__init__)
# Purpose:
# - Manages timed events with configurable durations, callbacks, and repeating behavior.
# - Tracks the passage of time and executes a callback function when the time duration has passed.
# 
# Parameters:
# - `duration` (int): The time in milliseconds that the timer will run before triggering the callback.
# - `func` (function, optional): A function to call once the timer reaches its duration.
# - `repeat` (int, optional): The number of times the timer should repeat. If `None`, the timer will not repeat.
# - `autostart` (bool, optional): Whether the timer should start automatically upon initialization. Defaults to `False`.
#
# Returns: None

## 🔄 __bool__()
# Purpose:
# - Allows the timer to be checked in conditional statements to determine if it is active.
#
# Returns: 
# - `True` if the timer is active, `False` if it is not.

## 🚦 activate()
# Purpose:
# - Activates the timer and begins counting down from the set duration.
#
# Returns: None

## 🚫 deactivate()
# Purpose:
# - Deactivates the timer and resets the start time.
# - If the timer is set to repeat, it will automatically reactivate.
#
# Returns: None

## ⏳ update()
# Purpose:
# - Updates the timer, checking if the current time has passed the specified duration.
# - If the duration has passed, it triggers the callback function (if provided) and deactivates the timer.
# - If the timer is set to repeat, it will reactivate after execution.
#
# Returns: None
