# ðŸ“‚ Asset Importer - Game Documentation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
# This Python file provides functions for importing game assets such as images, audio, and tile-based sprites.
# These functions are used to dynamically load assets from directories and return structured dictionaries.

## ðŸ“¥ folder_importer(*path)
# Purpose:
# - Loads and organizes image assets from a specified directory.
#
# Parameters:
# - path (tuple): The directory path to import images from.
#
# Functionality:
# 1. Iterates through the directory.
# 2. Loads each image and converts it to an optimized format.
# 3. Stores images in a dictionary with their filenames (excluding extensions) as keys.
#
# Returns:
# - Dictionary containing image surfaces indexed by filename.

## ðŸ”Š audio_importer(*path)
# Purpose:
# - Loads and organizes audio assets from a specified directory.
#
# Parameters:
# - path (tuple): The directory path to import audio files from.
#
# Functionality:
# 1. Iterates through the directory.
# 2. Loads each audio file as a Pygame sound object.
# 3. Stores audio objects in a dictionary with their filenames (excluding extensions) as keys.
#
# Returns:
# - Dictionary containing audio objects indexed by filename.

## ðŸŽ­ tile_importer(cols, *path)
# Purpose:
# - Loads and slices tile-based sprite sheets into individual frames.
#
# Parameters:
# - cols (int): The number of columns in the sprite sheet.
# - path (tuple): The directory path to import tile images from.
#
# Functionality:
# 1. Loads a sprite sheet image.
# 2. Slices the image into equal-width frames.
# 3. Stores frames in a dictionary indexed by filename.
#
# Returns:
# - Dictionary containing lists of frame surfaces for each tile set.
