# ðŸŽ® AllSprites - Game Documentation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
# This module defines the **AllSprites** class, which manages and renders all game sprites.
# It ensures that objects are drawn in the correct order to maintain visual depth.

## ðŸ›  Initialization (__init__)
# Purpose:
# - Initializes a custom sprite group that handles rendering with an offset.
# - Stores a reference to the game display surface.
# - Sets up an **offset vector** to manage camera movement.
#
# Parameters: None
# Returns: None

## ðŸŽ¨ draw(target_pos)
# Purpose:
# - Renders all sprites with an offset, simulating a camera effect centered on the player.
#
# Parameters:
# - target_pos (tuple): The coordinates of the player or main focus object.
#
# Functionality:
# 1. Adjusts the **offset vector** to center the camera on the target position.
# 2. Separates **ground sprites** (stationary objects like floors) from **object sprites** (dynamic entities like enemies and the player).
# 3. Sorts objects by their **Y-coordinate** to maintain proper rendering depth.
# 4. Draws sprites on the display surface using their adjusted positions.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
# - `pygame`: For handling sprite groups and rendering.
# - `settings.py`: Contains game configuration values such as `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT`.

## ðŸš€ Execution
# - Used within the game's main rendering loop to draw all objects with perspective depth.
